        <h2>My Why</h2>
        <p>On some level we are all part of the same tribe. When you look at the vastness of space and how empty it is, even with all our faults... The human race is worth preserving.
            Just like you, I beat out a lot of competition to get here, and I ain't keen on spending it all willy-nilly. I'm going to leave things better than when I found them.
            I'm going to uplift those around me, encourage them to shoot their shot, because as far as I'm aware, we only experience what this universe has to offer one time.
            Would be cool to be wrong, but I think its better to behave as if I'm right, and learn as I go. I want to learn everything I can, so that I can teach the next batch and give
            them the best chance I can of pushing us farther. Who's going to be the one to solve Alzheimers? Cancer? You think human development is on an exponential curve? What happens
            as less of us have to spend our mental resources on that first tier of Maslow's hierarchy? That's the world I want to live in. That's my why.

        <h2>The Who</h2>
        <p>
        My name is Victor Gavojdea, and I'd love to be your friend! I'm first generation American, my parents came from Romania to have a better life, they made huge sacrifices and took 
        the biggest risks just for the opportunity. Family is a big part of who I am, and I am blessed to have a big family full of amazing examples, not just from my parents, I am the 
        youngest of 7 with all but 2 of us being adopted* into the family.

        <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <p>
            I have two wonderful children that amaze me and help me grow every day. I also persue personal growth and developing myself. I believe Perfection is an ideal, not a destination.
            by persuing that I can best help the people in my life. On a lighter note I also enjoy fantasy and science fiction, I currently run games of Dungeons and Dragons 5e as well as 
            participate in some *light* worldbuilding for my homebrewed setting. I play Minecraft from time to time, The Elder Scrolls is my favorite game franchise.
