        <p>Dungeons & Dragons (commonly abbreviated as D&D or DnD) is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game (RPG) originally designed by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson.</p>
        <p>D&D departs from traditional wargaming by allowing each player to create their own character to play instead of a military formation. These characters embark upon imaginary adventures within a fantasy setting. A Dungeon Master (DM) serves as the game's referee and storyteller, while maintaining the setting in which the adventures occur, and playing the role of the inhabitants of the game world. The characters form a party and they interact with the setting's inhabitants and each other. Together they solve dilemmas, engage in battles, explore, and gather treasure and knowledge. In the process, the characters earn experience points (XP) in order to rise in levels, and become increasingly powerful over a series of separate gaming sessions.</p>

        <h2>Homebrew World</h2>
        <p>I've taken some time to develop my own setting in which my players can have their adventures in, I call this setting Solaris. This setting has a number of custom mechanics that relate to the setting, but most Dungeon Masters have their own home-brewed rules regardless of the system they play in. The DnD 5e ruleset is a guideline, and DMs are encouraged to run their game the way they see fit.</p>
        <p>Below I've included my personal homebrew rules that I've stolen from other DMs and found through playing at the table.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Whispers</h3></li>
            <p>The DM may from time to time pass you a note. You are free to read the contents of the note to anyone BUT you MAY NOT EVER show them the note. The note may or may not have anything written on it. Sometimes they are just nonsense like "you saw a crow land on a branch", sometimes it just says "Please respond to this note". Since the players can never show the note they can claim that it says whatever they want and it builds a certain level of paranoia while keeping information that would legitimately be private to a player actually private. If I need to tell a player something long I just take them to another room but I don't like doing that as it leaves most of the players just sitting. You should also prepare notes prior to the game when possible to speed things up.ï»¿
            </p>
            <li><h3>Click!</h3></li>
            <p>When a trap is triggered, a sound is given, alerting the party to the fact that they are in imminent danger, they may perform one quick reaction in hopes of avoiding the effects of the trap.
            </p>
            <li><h3>Tales by the Campfire</h3></li>
            <p>	While sitting around the campfire or drowning in ale at the local tavern, have each player draw a card from the deck
                Hearts represent love, Clubs represent pain, Spade is for loss and diamond is for gain.
            </p>
            <li><h3>DM Inspiration Votes</h3></li>
            <p>		At the end of each session, party votes for someone to receive DM inspiration for the next session. One time triple-advantage roll, or bonus XP if not used by the end of next session.
                <b>Expanded Inspiration Uses:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can replace ANY d20 roll from you or the DM</li>
                    <li>May turn a hit into a Crit</li>
                    <li>Gain an extra reaction</li>
                    <li>[EXPERIMENTAL] Use an inspiration to gain an extra attack</li>
                    <li>[EXPERIMENTAL] Have a stroke of inspiration - figure something out.</li>
                    <li>[EXPERIMENTAL] 3 inspirations put together may overrule the DM</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <li><h3>Stacked Advantage/Disadvantage</h3></li>
            <p>any imposed dis/adv beyond the first results in a +/-2 modifier</p>
            <li><h3>Glancing Attacks</h3></li>
            <p>If attack roll = AC, the damage is halved, applies to monsters and PCs</p>
            <li><h3>Brutal Criticals</h3></li>
            <p>Crits are max damage + roll + stats</p>
            <li><h3>Quoffing Potions</h3></li>
            <p>Taking a potion yourself is a bonus action, applying a potion to someone else is an action</p>
            <li><h3>Cleave Rules</h3></li>
            If you do more damage than needed to kill a mook/henchman monster, the damage can carry over to other nearby mooks.
            <li><h3>Triple Team</h3></li>
            When a creature and 2 of its allies have an enemy in melee, melee attacks are at advantage and ranged attacks are at disadvantage
            <li><h3>Free Action</h3></li>
            Most ability checks in combat can be done without taking an action.
            <li><h3>Finesse/Expanded Weapons</h3></li>
            <li><h3>Secret Death Saves</h3></li>
            Death saves are rolled secretly between the Player and DM
            <li><h3>Spell Scrolls</h3></li>
            Anyone can use spell scrolls. User must make an Arcana Check with the DC = 10 + spell level
            <li><h3>Languages</h3></li>
            Languages exist on a percentile die. A player's base language automatically starts at 100%. Other languages after that will exist somewhere else on the scale which may be rolled for upon character creation. In order to become better at a certain language, you need to spend 1 day + one GP to gain 1 percentile (using either a teacher or a book of some kind). So if a player is 30% proficient in Elvish, they will need to spend 50 days and 50 Gold Pieces in order to become 80% proficient with the language. During an encounter, a player can make an Int check to try to pick up some of the language, if they succeed, they gain 1 percent proficiency in it without having to spend the gold. Whenever attempting to speak the language, a player will role a percentile dice. In order to succeed at getting their idea across, they simply need to role within their percentile score.
            <li><h3>Carry Capacity</h3></li>
            You can carry your STR before becoming encumbered and a max of 1.5x your strength rounded up to the nearest integer.
            <ul>
                <li>Worn equipment = 0</li>
                <li>Coins = 1/1000 (round to nearest integer)</li>
                <li>Light items = 1 (<5lbs)</li>
                <li>Medium items = 2 (5<20lbs)</li>
                <li>Heavy items = 5 (20<80lbs)</li>
                <li>Custom = (>80lbs)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
